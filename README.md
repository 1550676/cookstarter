The microservices-based application for submitting remote requests for cooking in catering organizations-cafes, restaurants, pizzerias.
Wherever you need to wait for the order to be prepared.

Examples:
1. A group of businessmen go to negotiate in a restaurant, make an order on the way. By the time they arrive, the food is ready and served.
2. Someone sends an order to the pizzeria on the way home for takeaway, then passes by and picks up the order.

I worked on a service responsible for users' registration and authentication (title of module: cookstarter-customer-service) with Spring and REST API.
